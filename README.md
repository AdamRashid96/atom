Chemotaxis
==========
Chemotaxis is when an organism moves toward or away from a chemical stimulus like food. Biologists write software using [random walks](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/random.htm) to model and study [how very small organisms like bacteria search for food](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/). In this assignment you will create a simulation of organisms moving away from a starting position using a random walk. To start the assignment, clone your project. The [Arrays of Objects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTZ1FCOTZrWS1pb3M/view?usp=sharing) worksheet might be helpful. NOTE: you must use `Math.random()` for all the random numbers in this assignment. 

Requirements
============
1. A class to represent a single bacteria or some other single organism. The class will have the following members:
   - 3 ints which hold the x and y coordinates of the bacteria position, and the bacteria color.
   - A constructor which initializes the 3 ints
   - `void move()` which moves the bacteria in a **random walk** pattern.
   - `void show()` which draws the bacteria using the three member variables 
2. You will then use an array to store many *instances* of the Bacteria. 
3. Personalize the title, headline and footer of `index.html`
4. Your simulation doesn't have to look like any other. Have fun and be creative.
   
Extas
==========
If you have extra time, you might try:
* To have the bacteria move in a "biased random walk" towards some stimulus like a piece of food or the mouse. 
* You can use the mouse buttons to adjust the bias towards or away from the mouse. 
* You can modify your class so the bacteria have a finite lifespan and can reproduce. 
* You can simulate other organisms besides bacteria and even have multiple types of organisms like a predator and prey.
